# Session State — Continuation Reference

**Purpose:** Enable a fresh Claude Code session to resume this project correctly without
re-reading full conversation history. `CLAUDE.md` remains the governing architecture
document — this file is a status snapshot, not a replacement for it. Read `CLAUDE.md`
and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` in full before acting; this is a pointer/summary layer
on top of them.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-29, Stage 5 code complete, awaiting DG-3 for the final headline
partition choice.

## 1. What this project is

Privacy-preserving pneumonia detection via federated learning across simulated
hospitals. Full detail: `CLAUDE.md` §1–§2. One-line summary: hospitals train locally on
chest X-rays that never leave their storage; only DP-noised, SecAgg+-masked model
updates travel over TLS+client-auth to a FedAvg server. Explainability (Grad-CAM) and
uncertainty (MC Dropout) are added on top. The paper's core deliverable is a 6-row
ablation table quantifying what each privacy layer costs (`CLAUDE.md` §11.1).

## 2. Architecture (pointer, not restated in full — see CLAUDE.md §3, §5–§10)

- **Topology:** star/hub-and-spoke FL. One `ClientApp`/`ServerApp` codebase, two
  execution engines (simulation for measurement, Docker Compose deployment for
  demonstration) — ADR-8.
- **Model:** DenseNet121, ImageNet-pretrained, **frozen backbone** (BatchNorm in
  `eval()`, frozen running stats) + small trainable head — **ADR-1, the load-bearing
  decision of the whole project**. Not yet implemented (Stage 8).
- **Privacy stack:** Opacus DP-SGD (sample-level, per-client/local DP — ADR-2) +
  Flower SecAgg+ (ADR-3, no custom crypto) + TLS with client auth (ADR-4). None of
  this is implemented yet — Stages 14–16.
- **This is a CLI/script/notebook-driven ML research pipeline — there is no web
  frontend, no page routing, and no CMS/content-management layer.** ("Navigation
  architecture" and "content-management architecture" from a generic project template
  do not apply here; the closest analogues are the Hydra config tree (§6 below) and the
  dataset/manifest pipeline (§4 below), both covered there instead.)

## 3. Approved technology stack (exact pins — `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`)

Python 3.11.16 (pinned `>=3.11,<3.12` — not 3.12, ADR-5). Environment managed by `uv`.

## 4. Datasets (Stage 3 — see §7 for exactly what's done)

**Decision (resolved 2026-08-29, recorded in `CLAUDE.md` §14):** two-source strategy —
**Kermany = Hospital A**, **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge = Hospitals B & C**.

| Dataset | Source | Size (measured, not estimated) | Files | Location |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kermany | Mendeley Data, doi:10.17632/rscbjbr9sj.3 | 8.4GB zip (bundled w/ unrelated OCT data — plan's 1.2GB estimate was for a 3rd-party Kaggle mirror, not the authoritative source) | 5,856 JPEG images | `data/raw/kermany/CellData/chest_xray/{train,test}/{NORMAL,PNEUMONIA}/` |
| RSNA | Kaggle competition `rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge` | 3.96GB (measured by paginating the Kaggle API before download — plan's ~12GB estimate was wrong) | 29,684 DICOM files | `data/raw/rsna/{stage_2_train_images,stage_2_test_images}/` + label CSVs at `data/raw/rsna/*.csv` |

Both validated: **zero checksum mismatches, zero corrupt files** (see
`data/manifests/{kermany,rsna}_validation_report.json`).

**RSNA DICOM findings (relevant to Stage 6 CLAHE preprocessing):** all images uniformly
1024×1024, `PhotometricInterpretation=MONOCHROME2` for all files, **no**
`RescaleSlope`/`RescaleIntercept` present on any file (raw pixel values — no linear
rescale step needed before CLAHE, simplifying Stage 6 vs. the generic DICOM risk
`CLAUDE.md` flags).

**RSNA label structure** (26,684 unique patients, from `stage_2_train_labels.csv` +
`stage_2_detailed_class_info.csv`): Normal 8,851 / No Lung Opacity–Not Normal 11,821 /
Lung Opacity (pneumonia) 6,012. `stage_2_train_labels.csv` has one row per bounding box
— multiple rows per patient for some Lung Opacity cases; dedupe by `patientId` before
counting (the validator in `scripts/validate_datasets.py` already does this correctly).

**Decision Gate DG-2 — RESOLVED 2026-08-29, written back into `CLAUDE.md` §14 and
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Stage 4.** Owner chose **option (a): keep RSNA's native
Target grouping** (Normal + No-Lung-Opacity-Not-Normal both map to the negative class),
for benchmark comparability and to preserve the full 20,672-patient negative class. The
clinical caveat (model learns "abnormal-but-not-pneumonia" = "normal") is to be stated
as an honest limitation in the paper, not engineered around. Implemented in
`src/data/labels.py::load_rsna_records()`.

**Correction (found while implementing Stage 4): Kermany's normal-class patient-ID
limitation, as originally stated in `CLAUDE.md`/the plan, does not apply to the actual
data used.** The authoritative Mendeley source's filenames are
`<CLASS>-<accession-id>-<seq>.jpeg` for *both* NORMAL and PNEUMONIA — the accession id
is a genuine, groupable patient/study identifier for both classes (verified: zero id
collisions across classes or the source's own train/test split, across all 5,856
files). This is a different, better-structured naming convention than the third-party
Kaggle mirror the original limitation note was written against. `CLAUDE.md` §15 item 8
has been corrected accordingly.

Raw data and the two big archive zips are **not** committed (gitignored) but **do**
exist on disk right now — see §9 known-state notes.

**Frozen splits (Stage 4, `seed=1000`, `val_frac=test_frac=0.15`, patient-grouped +
label-stratified via `src/data/splitting.py::grouped_stratified_split`):**

| Source | train | val | test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kermany (images / patients) | 4,180 / 2,155 | 841 / 463 | 835 / 463 |
| RSNA (images = patients) | 18,678 | 4,003 | 4,003 |

Full per-split label counts are in `data/partitions/{kermany,rsna}_splits.json`
(`summary` key) — both correctly proportion Normal:Pneumonia within ~1.5x of the overall
ratio per split (verified by `tests/test_splitting.py::test_class_balance_preserved_per_split`
against the general splitting logic; the real-data split was inspected manually, not
re-asserted by a dedicated test against the live files).

## 5. Reproducibility spine (Stage 2 — implemented)

- `conf/config.yaml`: `seed=42`, `data_partition_seed=1000`, `client_sampling_seed=2000`
  tracked as three separate values (per `CLAUDE.md` §12's warning that the latter two
  are the most commonly forgotten in FL work).
- `src/utils/seeding.py`: `set_global_seed()`, `seed_worker()`, `make_generator()`.
  `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True, warn_only=<config flag>)`.
- `src/utils/logging.py`: `configure_logging()` / `get_logger()`.
- `src/utils/mlflow_utils.py`: `tracked_run()` context manager — logs fully resolved
  config (dotted-key flatten) + git SHA at run start.

## 6. Configuration decisions worth knowing

- **MLflow tracking backend is `sqlite:///mlruns.db`, not `file:./mlruns`.** MLflow
  3.15.2 deprecated the plain filesystem store (raises `MlflowException` by default).
  SQLite is still fully local/offline — does not conflict with `CLAUDE.md`'s "local,
  self-hosted, no third-party cloud" requirement. `mlruns.db`/`mlflow.db` are
  gitignored.
- **CUDA build is `+cu126`** (not cu129/cu130/cu132, which are also available for
  torch 2.13.0/cp311) — chosen as the stable middle ground for the RTX 3050 (driver
  595.84).
- **`torch.use_deterministic_algorithms` has a `warn_only` escape hatch** in
  `conf/config.yaml` (`deterministic.warn_only`) for the known risk that some CUDA
  kernels have no deterministic implementation — currently `false` (strict).

## 7. Stage-by-stage status (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Part IV is authoritative for stage definitions)

| Stage | Status | Commit(s) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Repository foundation | **Done** | `038b7ab` |
| 1 — Pinned Python 3.11 env | **Done** | `4ab5922` |
| 2 — Config, seeding, MLflow tracking | **Done**, 8/8 tests passing | `86e36a7` |
| 3 — Dataset acquisition & validation | **Done**, both datasets, zero data-integrity issues | `3aea1f0` (Kermany), `74c6ea5` (RSNA) |
| 4 — Label harmonization & patient-level splitting | **Done** — DG-2 applied, both sources fully patient-grouped, 18 tests passing, splits frozen in `data/partitions/{kermany,rsna}_splits.json` | `28131be` |
| 5 — Hospital partitioning | **Code complete, 25/25 tests passing.** Natural partition (Kermany=A, RSNA→B/C, full imbalance) and a Dirichlet alpha-sweep demo are built and on disk. **DG-3 (below) is open — do not treat this stage as finished/committed until it's answered**, since the answer may add a size-balanced variant alongside the natural one. | (uncommitted) |
| 6 — CLAHE preprocessing + cache | Not started | — |
| 7 — torchvision transforms/Dataset/DataLoader | Not started | — |
| 8–23 | Not started | — |

**Phase 0 (Stages 0–2) and Phase 1's Stages 3–4 are complete. Stage 5's code is written
and its natural/Dirichlet outputs generated, but not yet committed — blocked on DG-3.**

## 8. Pending decisions / open decision gates

- **DG-2 (label harmonization): RESOLVED and applied**, see §4.
- **DG-3 (hospital-size imbalance handling, Stage 5): OPEN, blocking.** Measured (not
  estimated) via `scripts/build_partitions.py`: natural partition gives Hospital A
  (Kermany) 5,856 images / 3,081 patients vs. Hospitals B and C (RSNA shards) 13,342
  images / 13,342 patients **each** — roughly 4.5x. The plan's own recommendation is to
  report both the natural-imbalance and a size-balanced variant rather than picking
  one, but this has not been put to the owner as an explicit choice yet — do that
  before treating Stage 5 as finished.
- **Dropout placement** (head-only vs. after dense blocks, `CLAUDE.md` §14 item, needed
  at Stage 8): open.
- **Target epsilon values** for the DP sweep + delta relative to dataset size (needed
  at Stage 14): open.
- **Client count** / default partition scheme for headline results (needed at Stage 5):
  open, related to DG-3.

No dependency, architecture, or technology-stack changes are currently awaiting
approval — the last one (adding `requests`) was resolved and committed in Stage 3.

## 9. Known state / things to be aware of (not bugs, but worth knowing)

- **~15.6GB of raw data + archives currently on local disk**, all gitignored, none of
  it committed: `data/raw/kermany` (1.2G), `data/raw/rsna` (3.8G),
  `data/_downloads/ZhangLabData.zip` (7.9G, kept for provenance),
  `data/_downloads/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge.zip` (3.7G). Disk has 299GB free
  as of last check — not urgent, but the two zips can be deleted once you're confident
  the extracted+checksummed data is sufficient (the manifests retain the source hashes
  for provenance either way).
- **Kermany's official train/test split (this Mendeley source) has no validation
  fold** — resolved by Stage 4's own split, which carves train/val/test from scratch
  across *all* of Kermany's images regardless of the source's original train/test
  labels (kept only as `source_native_split` metadata, unused for our splitting).
- ~~Kermany's NORMAL-class filenames carry no patient identifier~~ — **this was wrong,
  corrected during Stage 4, see §4.** Both classes are fully patient-groupable in the
  actual source used.
- **RSNA's `stage_2_test_images/` (3,000 DICOMs) is unlabeled** (Kaggle's held-out
  competition test set, ground truth never released) and is correctly excluded from
  `load_rsna_records()` — all usable RSNA data comes from the 26,684-patient
  `stage_2_train_images/` + `stage_2_train_labels.csv` pool, which Stage 4 then splits
  into our own train/val/test.
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s stale dataset-size estimates, the Kermany
  patient-ID claim, and the "no implementation has begun" closing line have all been
  corrected during Stage 4 — the plan document is now consistent with actual state
  (though `docs/SESSION_STATE.md`, this file, remains the authoritative live-status
  pointer per its own closing note in the plan doc).
- 18 pytest tests pass (8 from Stage 2 + 3 label tests + 7 splitting tests); working
  tree has Stage 4 changes staged/ready to commit as of writing this file.

## 10. Git status

**Branch:** `main`. As of writing, `74c6ea5` (Stage 3) plus a follow-up docs-only commit
(`d330dbd`, this file's first version) are pushed to `origin/main`; Stage 4's code
(`src/data/labels.py`, `src/data/splitting.py`, `scripts/build_splits.py`,
`data/partitions/{kermany,rsna}_splits.json`, `tests/test_labels.py`,
`tests/test_splitting.py`) plus the `CLAUDE.md`/`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` DG-2 and
Kermany-patient-ID corrections are about to be committed as the next commit on top of
that. Check `git log --oneline -5` on resume — this file is not re-updated after every
single commit within a session, only at natural pause points.

```
d330dbd Add docs/SESSION_STATE.md for cross-session continuity
74c6ea5 Stage 3 complete: RSNA acquired, checksummed, validated (DICOM)
3aea1f0 Stage 3 (partial): Kermany acquisition, checksummed and validated
86e36a7 Stage 2: configuration, seeding and MLflow tracking
4ab5922 Stage 1: pinned Python 3.11 environment (ADR-5)
```

**Standing authorization:** owner granted full autonomy for Phase 1 (commands,
downloads, commits, pushes) — stopping only at decision gates or genuine architecture
conflicts. Not yet confirmed whether this extends past Phase 1; ask if a fresh session
is unsure before pushing through a later phase boundary unprompted.

## 11. Exact next recommended step

Stage 5's code, tests, configs, natural partition, and Dirichlet-sweep demo are all
built (see §7) but the resulting **DG-3 question has been put to the owner and is
awaiting an answer**: keep the natural ~4.5x imbalance as the headline result, add a
size-balanced variant (e.g. subsample RSNA shards down toward Kermany's size) as an
additional config, or report both. Once answered:

1. If a balanced variant is wanted, add it to `src/data/partitioning.py` /
   `scripts/build_partitions.py` and regenerate.
2. Commit Stage 5 (code + whichever partition JSON(s) are wanted) and update this file.
3. Move to Stage 6 (OpenCV CLAHE preprocessing + cache, ADR-6) — first REQUIRED stage
   of Phase 2, no open decision gates block it.
